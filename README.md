# layerfusion

**Developer suite for generating layered artwork**

</div>

Art engine for generating assets and the related metadata from a collection of layers.

**This is very much an experimental project still and development is ongoing, please do not use in production.**

The engine is currently able to take layer order and rarity into account. The code is **_definitely not_** optimized and many performance and syntax improvements can be made. That being said, the engine can successfully randomly generate a collection of arbitrary size, taking rarity into account. Currently the engine has only been tested with `.png` and `.jpg` files.
